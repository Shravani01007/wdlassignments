    <h2>My Life</h2> 
    <p>
    I lived 6 months in Mumbai, at Marine Lines, around 1.5 km from Church Gate local station.
    So most of the evenings, I used to sit at Marine Drive chaupati watching sea waves and sun set, eating fried ground nuts. 
    Since Mumbai doesn’t have hot or harsh summers, it makes a very pleasing and beautifull view in the evening.
    It becomes even more thrilling at the time of high tides, when the waves rise around 60–80 feet and attack the chaupati.
    Sometimes I walked to Gate Way of India, crossing Colaba and sat there. Evenings are filled with a lot of local/foreign visitors.
